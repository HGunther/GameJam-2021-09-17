# Visual Studio Setup
You can setup Visual Studio Code as an effective editor using [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/other/unity) guide. The general steps are:
* Set Visual Stduio Code as Unity's default editor
* Install the Unity extension
* Enable code completion by downloading a missing .NET pack
* Enabling Unity Warnings should already be setup though the NuGet package and OmniSharp file included in the repository.

When you open the project, is may ask you if you want to open the `Project-csharp.sln` file or the `Project.sln` file. Open the `-csharp.sln` file.
